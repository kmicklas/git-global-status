# git-global-status

This is a small script to track basic status information across all git repos in a directory.
I have many dozens of repos in my home directory and the goal is to be able to quickly know which of them need attention to be in a fully "backed up" (i.e. pushed) state.
Additionally I'd like to know which repos are clean clones of third-party projects which I haven't made any changes in, so I can potentially remove them to declutter.

## TODO

- [ ] Untracked files
- [ ] Unpushed branches
- [ ] Clean third-party repos
- [ ] Parallel scanning
- [ ] Colors
